            <li>3 dried guajillo chilies, seeds discarded</li>
            <li>2 dried pasilla chiles, seeds discarded</li>
            <li>1 cup boiling water, or as needed to cover</li>
            <li>2 pork tenderloins, membranes (silver skin) removed</li>
            <li>¾ cup pineapple juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white vinegar</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cumin, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried oregano, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 onion diced and cilantro</li>
            <li>1/2 pineapple sliced </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place dried guajillo and pasilla chiles into a bowl and pour in boiling water to cover. Let chiles stand 30 minutes to soften.</li>
            <li>Cut pork tenderloins in half crosswise and in half again lengthwise again to make 8 long strips.</li>
            <li>Drain water from chiles and pour in pineapple juice and vinegar. Add garlic cloves, chipotle pepper, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, cumin, and oregano. Transfer chile mixture to a blender and blend to make a smooth marinade.</li>
            <li>Place pork into a resealable plastic bag and pour marinade over pork; knead bag several times to coat pork. Squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat outdoor grill (preferably charcoal) for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove pork from bag and drain and discard marinade; transfer pork to a platter. Drizzle meat with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil and season with salt. Use tongs to gently stir pork pieces to coat lightly with oil.</li>
            <li>Cook pork strips on preheated grill until meat shows good grill marks and is lightly pink in the center, 7 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the largest piece should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer pork to a fresh platter.</li>
            <li>Drizzle a nonstick skillet with 1 teaspoon vegetable oil and place over medium heat. Lay a tortilla into the hot oil and place 1 slice of Monterey Jack cheese into center of the tortilla. Cook until tortilla is hot, lightly browned on the bottom, and cheese has melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining tortillas and cheese slices. Transfer each tortilla to a plate.</li>
            <li>Slice pork strips across the grain into pieces about 1/4 inch thick. Divide shredded cabbage onto each tortilla and top each with about 6 slices of pork, 1 tablespoon roasted tomato salsa,a pinch of onion diced and cilantro and 1 slice of pineapple. Fold taco over fillings to eat.</li>
